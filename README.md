>Risk is an important component when constructing a trading strategy. However, most of the previous works that make the market movement prediction on the basis of the opinions on social media platforms do not take the risk into consideration. In order to hedge the market- and sector-risk, we propose an idea of an opinion-based pair trading strategy. Comparing with the task setting of the previous works, our experimental results show that the neural network models with the pair-wise task setting perform better in both accuracy and profitability metrics. That introduces a new research direction for future researches on market movement predictions.
